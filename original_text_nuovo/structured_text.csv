"IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish tween the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then ver me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, suppose the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark odies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now"
"CHAPTER 7 MY RETURN, I FOUND THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FATHER ""My dear Victor, You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare nor do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have vou callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long rendered absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings. William is dead!-that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered! I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. ""This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder's finger was on his neck He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. Ar first 1 attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my darling child! She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it 43"
